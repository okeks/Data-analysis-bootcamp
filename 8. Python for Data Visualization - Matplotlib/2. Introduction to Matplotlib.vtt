00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.990
Hello everyone and welcome to the introduction to lib lecture and this lecture we're going to get a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.560
brief introduction of what Matt it is and then show you just a little bit of the Web site from plotless

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.300
.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:23.160
Matt lib or as some people pronounce it Matt plus libe is the most popular plodding library for Python

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.370
and it really gives you complete control over almost every aspect of a figure or plot and it's designed

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.950
to have a very similar feel to Matlab which is another programming language in its own graphical plotting

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.650
capabilities map plot lib works very well with Pandanus and umpire race which is why we're going to

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.100
learn about it later on.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.420
We're going to learn about some other libraries such as Seaborn that is actually built off of Matt Plup

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.900
live.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.500
But in order to understand those libraries it's important to understand that plot lived First you'll

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.450
need to install it with either Pipp or Konda at your command line or terminal with one of the following

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.580
commands for using the Anaconda distribution of python.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.270
A simple Konda install Matt Cutlip at your command line or terminal should install that live for you

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:06.660
.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.840
Or if you using another version of Python Pipp install matplotlib should also work for you.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.160
Now let's go ahead and get a quick tour of the official website.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.440
Ok here I am at that plot live org which is the official Web site for map plot lym you'll see here there's

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.220
some introduction information as well as some more official installation instructions and some other

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.890
documentation links.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.850
Probably the most important link on this page however is right here under gallery.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.430
If you click on gallery or go to that part live the org slash gallery you'll get taken to this link

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.710
and you should see a list of a bunch of different types of plot names.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.880
And if you keep scrolling down you'll see that there's a bunch of figures or example figures and these

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.310
are all the various types of plots that Cutlip is capable of creating for you.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.800
Later on we'll learn how to use other libraries that are better for things such as the fiscal plots

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.910
.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.470
But if you ever find yourself having a question of that plot lives capabilities you can come to this

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.580
page and search for the kind of plot you're looking for.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.960
For example if I go ahead and scroll back up here let's say you want to make a pie chart.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.800
Will you come here and there's a gallery look for where it says pie charts.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.640
Click here.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.980
High end polar charts.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.950
They'll come down to this link and then I'll show you some couple of figures here that are hopefully

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.360
relevant examples once you find one that looks like what you want to do is go in and click this first

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.240
one.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.420
It will take you to an example page that not only has to figure but also has very well commented code

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.800
and instructions on how to perform whatever plots you're looking for.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.170
In this case a pie chart.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.790
All right.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.740
So that's probably the most helpful page on that putt.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.000
The other links are just basically links to the documentation functions in it.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.600
And we're going to go over the most common functions as we continue on throughout this section of the

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.560
course.

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.220
All right.

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.570
Remember that matplotlib org is a resource for you especially the gallery page.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.950
Coming up next we're going to show you how to actually use Matt Plett live to create your own figures

00:02:58.950 --> 00:02:59.500
.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.440
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture
