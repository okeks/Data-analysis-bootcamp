00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.890
Now that we've finished learning about our data analysis libraries it's time to actually start visualizing

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:05.740
that data.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.970
We'll start off by learning about MAP plot live then we'll move on to seaborne for statistical plots

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:11.220
.

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.750
Afterwards we'll learn about pandas built in data visualization capabilities and then we'll see how

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.260
to use plot to create awesome interactive plots with just a few lines of Python code.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.610
Thank you so much and I'll see you at the next lecture.
