<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>A quick note on the Salary Exercise, one of the questions asks how many people have the word "chief" in their title. My solution is actually slightly off, I didn't take into account people that had punctuation in their title right next to the word chief, for example : Chief, Justice.Â </p><p>If you want to see a full discussion, search the qa forums for 'chief' , there are a lot of thread where students have posted alternative solutions that work correctly (there are a lot of ways to solve this one)</p><p>Thanks!<br></p><p>Jose</p>
